- **2026-09-02** — built in one evening as "DeepDive", a Tampermonkey userscript
  for Firefox Android: select text in a ChatGPT reply, collect fragments, send
  them back as one prompt. Copied into the phone by hand from a hosted page.
- **2026-09-02** — first real use on the phone. The composer stole focus while
  typing a note: ChatGPT's type-anywhere handler could not see our shadow-DOM
  inputs. Fixed by declaring the host editable and stopping key events at
  window-capture.
- **2026-09-03** — tap replaced text selection: a word, widened to sentence and
  paragraph, grown across paragraphs by tapping toward other words. Six
  rotating highlight colors. Per-conversation lists. Exports became the whole
  conversation, fragments appended.
- **2026-09-04** — renamed three times in one day. DigBoard collided with a
  scuba company; Winnow turned out to be a live Chrome extension; Pickaxe is an
  AI-agent platform. Assay screened clean on both stores. The lesson: search
  the stores before naming, which is now written into the contract.
- **2026-09-04** — release pipeline live: merge to master builds a reproducible
  package and mints a GitHub Release; v0.8.0 and v0.8.1 exist. Firefox's new
  data-collection declaration added (`required: ["none"]`) after the first AMO
  submission attempt rejected the manifest.
